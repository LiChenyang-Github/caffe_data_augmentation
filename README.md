# caffe_data_augmentation
This is a data_layer.cpp, in which I implement some data augmentation (such as morror, shrink, translate, brightness changing).       
**Attention**: Because this data_layer.cpp is for regression tasks, the `top_label` needs to be changed when carryinging morroring, shrinking and translation.
